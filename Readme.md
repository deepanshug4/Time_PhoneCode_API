## API Building and Front-end Connectivity.
* To get this done. We need data which is stored as "Data.txt"
* The server functionality and access to data is implemented in "ser.py"
* The API functionality and URL redirection is done using Flask shown in "new.py"
* Finally the frontend of this project is made using Bootstrap and is contained in "index.html"

For this project to run:
* Start the server for the frontend using "python -m http.server"
* Start the Flask server to get the API functionality running. This can be done using "> set FLASK_APP=new and > flask run"
* Now browse the index page and you're good to go.
